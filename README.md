# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2016-Labo-DockerMusic

## Admin

* You can work in teams of two students.
* You should fork and clone this repo. You should also configure an `upstream` repo, to be able to pull updates that we will publish in this original repo.
* There will not be a "full" lab grade for this long lab. However, there will *at least* one point to gain for the "salami" TE grade. Also, the skills that you will learn during this lab will be necessary for subsequent labs.
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on telegram or in the forum, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.
 
## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to get familiar with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in the previous lecture). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor should send a JSON payload containing the list of active musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 10 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | *TODO Insert your diagram here...* |
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| | *Musicians, every seconds* |
|Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | *The auditor (server), if the corresponding musician is not yet in the list, it is added to it* |
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | *The instrument’s name and sound, the musicians uuid and the timestamp reprensenting how long it has been active* |
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
| | *Each musician sends a JSON structure representing a musician. The auditor will contain an array of musicians which will be updated each time a UDP packet is received* |


## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**?
| | *With the comand JSON.stringify(object).*
|Question | What is **npm**?
| | *Node packet manager. The manager for the packets in Node.js*
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?
| | *Install a package from NPM inside the current dir. The –save flat will save the package inside the dependencies inside package.json*
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?
| | *To look for and download new packages to install*
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122?
| | *We used the latest version of package node-uuid (v 1.4.7)*
|Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis?
| | *setInterval(this.update.bind(this), 1000) for example to execute it every second*
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**?
| | *1. Create a socket with UDP 4 : var s = dgram.createSocket('udp4') 2. Send the datagram via that socket using the send command : s.send(message, 0, message.length, protocol.PROTOCOL_PORT, protocol.PROTOCOL_MULTICAST_ADDRESS, function(err, bytes) { console.log("Sending payload: " + payload + " via port " + s.address().port);})*
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**?
| | *Using : var type = process.argv[2], for axample to get the second argument*


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?
| | *Create the Dockerfile which contains the entry point, and use the command : docker build image_name*
|Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?
| | *We can use it to specify the path to the main source file of the image*
|Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**?
| | *Using the command: docker run image_name*
|Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?
| | *Using the command docker ps (we can also list all the non-running conteners)*
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?
| | *Using the command: docker kill container_id (the command of the previous question shows the container_id)*
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?
| | *By monitoring network traffic with a tool like tcpdump or udp*


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group?
| | *By specifying a Multicast address in the protocol.js file: exports.PROTOCOL_MULTICAST_ADDRESS = "239.255.22.5" and using it when sending the datagram through the socker*
|Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**? 
| | *We create a new map, than we bind the parameter to the map with the method get*
|Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting? 
| | *We didn't use that*
|Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**? 
| | *When a player connects to the TCP socket of the auditor, we used the filter method on the array*
|Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js? 
| | *With the net module*


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic
| ---  | ---
|Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image?
| | *We create multiple musicians and one auditor, than we check with tcpdump that the packets are sent well. Finally we check if the TCP server outputs the right JSON even after deleting some musicians*


## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
